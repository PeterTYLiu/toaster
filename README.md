# Toaster: Pure CSS 3D Modelling Suite

Toaster is a 3D editor for modelling in pure HTML + CSS. No WebGL, no canvas.

Special thanks to [Pawe≈Ç Kuna](https://github.com/codecalm) for adding my requested icons to the awesome [tabler-icons](https://github.com/tabler/tabler-icons) library!

## FAQ

### ‚ùì Are there any practical applications for this app?

Nope!

### ‚ùì Can I export/embed the model I made?

Nope! Although if you want such a feature, you are free to make a pull request!

### ‚ùì Didn't [Tridiv](http://tridiv.com/) do this like a decade ago?

Indeed - they were a great inspiration (their UX is still way better than mine!) Toaster has some key improvements over Tridiv:

- A node-based scene graph with parenting and property inheritence
- Complex solids like spheres, n-sided pyramids, etc. for more complex models
- A complete set of scale/rotate/translate transforms for each node

### ‚ùì The performance is terrible!

Yup ü§∑. When there's a model loaded, it's slow on Chrome, and pretty much unusable on Safari.
